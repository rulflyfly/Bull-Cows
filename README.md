# Bull-Cows

An Isogram guessing game :)

Isogram is a word where every letter repeats only once

We call the letters in your guess Bulls and Cows

A bull is a letter in your guess that IS in the hidden word and sits AT THE SAME PLACE in your guess word

A cow is a letter in your guess that IS in the hidden word but sits AT A WRONG PLACE in your guess word

If the hidden word, let's say, is "planet"

And you enter "penutt" (forgive me for a non existent word)

Here you have 2 bulls - "p" and "t"
And 2 cows - "n" and "e"

I hope this is not outrageously confusing :3
